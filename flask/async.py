    the parameter GALAXY_URL in this request. The value of this parameter contains
    the url where Galaxy will expect the response to be sent at some later time.
    The external site's responsibility is to keep track of this URL as long as the
    user navigates the external site.

    4. When Galaxy receives the parameters it will run a URL fetching process
    in the background that will resubmit the parameters to the datasource, and
    it will deposit the returned data in the user's account.


    This process operates similarly to the synchronous one, the exception being
    that the datasource will have to later notify Galaxy with the location of
    the data.

    1. The same as steps 1. through 4. for the synchronous data depositing. For
    the step 4 above, Galaxy will create another parameter GALAXY_URL that will
    uniquely characterize the data that is returned. The result of the
    resubmission step of this step is a data entry that is waiting for the data
    source. 1. When the data created by the datasource is ready the datasource
    will have to reconnect to the url specified in GALAXY_URL and submit via
    HTTP GET the STATUS and URL parameters. Galaxy will then make a background
    request to fetch the data stored at the location URL.

    Inter-process communication is performed via a very simple text outputs.
    Commands that have been executed correctly may write any kind of text
    messages. If the text ends with the word OK it will be considered a
    successful submission. Messages that do not end with OK will be treated as
    errors. There is no requirement on interpreting any of the messages; they
    primarily serve for informational/debugging purposes.

    Example Upon returning to the datasource (step 4) Galaxy submits the
    following:

        http://www.data.org/search?value=1&limit=10&gene=HBB1&GALAXY_URL=http://test.g2.bx.psu.edu/async/search/a4mr3ks4j1

    The datasource may then write the following as response:

        received parameters:
        value=1
        limit=10
        gene=HBB1
        GALAXY_URL=http://test.g2.bx.psu.edu/async/search/a4mr3ks4j1
        running query in the background
        closing connection
        OK

    Then, upon a finished data generation this same datasource would make the following request:

        http://test.g2.bx.psu.edu/async/search/a4mr3ks4j1?STATUS=OK&URL=http://www.data.org/temp/1299292.dat

    to which Galaxy could answer:

        Data will be retrieved
        OK
